# **Movie Revenue Prediction and Sentiment Analysis**

#### 

###### Overview

The project is a prediction of movie revenue through machine learning regression models and sentiment analysis of movie viewers from IMDB movie reviews through NLP (VADER). The project uses both structured data and text data, which reflects end-to-end data science and natural language processing capabilities.





###### Tools \& Technologies

\- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

\- Regression Models: Linear Regression and Random Forest

\- Sentiment Analysis: VADER Sentiment Intensity Analyzer

\- Datasets: TMDB 5000 movies data and IMDB 50K movie reviews data





###### Project Workflow

1\. Cleaning and combination of TMDB datasets

2\. Regression modeling for movie revenue prediction (linear and random forest)

3\. Feature importance analysis (budget was the most important)

4\. Sentiment analysis of IMDB reviews with VADER

5\. Comparison of VADER sentiment with IMDB sentiment labels

6\. Visualization of outcomes such as word clouds for both positive and negative reviews





###### Results

\- Random Forest regression RÂ² score of 0.61 on log-transformed revenue

\- VADER sentiment accuracy of ~69% against IMDB sentiment labels

\- Budget being the most significant predictor of revenue

\- Visual insights through scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds





###### How to Run

1\. Clone the repository and extract all.

2\. Open Jupyter notebook `Movie.ipynb`

3\. Execute all cells in order after installing package dependencies (see notebook titles)

4\. Visuals are stored as PNG files in the repository for reference
