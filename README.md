# Data Science Projects Portfolio

Here is my Data Science project portfolio. This repository contains two finished, real-world projects that illustrate data cleaning, predictive models, sentiment analysis, SQL, and business intelligence dashboards.


## Movie Success Prediction & Sentiment Study

###  Folder: `Movie_success_&_SentimentG/`

### Objective:
Predicting box office revenue of films using regression models and sentiment analysis of audiences using Natural Language Processing.

### Tools & Libraries:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK - VADER)
- Visualizations: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
- Dataset: TMDB & IMDB datasets

### Key Highlights:
- Developed Linear and Random Forest Regression models to forecast revenue.
- Achieved R² = **0.61** with Random Forest after log transformation.
- Performed sentiment analysis on 50,000 IMDB reviews with VADER.
- Compared VADER sentiments vs IMDB-labeled sentiments (69% agreement).
- Developed visualizations such as feature importance plots, actual vs predicted revenue plots, sentiment pie charts, and word clouds.

### Files:
- `Movie_Success_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`
- `predictive_model_summary.md`
- Visuals folder (all `.png` plots and word clouds)
- Final 2-page PDF report


## Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis

### Folder: `Retail-analysis-ProjectG/`

### Objective:
To investigate, clean, and analyze the retail sales data to derive insights on business performance, product category trends, and profitability.

### Tools & Libraries:
- MySQL / SQL for querying the data
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Tableau / Power BI for dashboarding
- Dataset: Kaggle's Online Retail II Dataset

### Key Highlights:
- Conducted SQL-based data cleaning and exploration
- Developed sales summary reports with aggregation queries
- Constructed interactive dashboards displaying sales, profits, trends

### Files:
- `Retail_Business_Performance.ipynb`
- SQL queries (optional `.sql` file or within notebook)
- Dashboard screenshots / `.pbix` or `.twbx` file
- Final PDF report
